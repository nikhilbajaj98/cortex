**üß† CORTEX**

Cortex is an autonomous, event-driven microservice control plane ‚Äî think of it as a ‚Äúmission control‚Äù system for microservices across your organization.
It provides:

- Real-time observability,
- Self-healing orchestration, and
- AI-assisted decision-making across distributed services.

It sits above Kubernetes (or ECS, or any orchestrator) and acts as an intelligent brain that monitors, adapts, and optimizes how your system behaves.

‚öôÔ∏è Analogy: If Kubernetes schedules and runs your pods, Cortex thinks about why they‚Äôre running, how they‚Äôre performing, and what should change automatically.

**üß© The Problem It Solves**

Modern distributed systems are:

- Hard to observe holistically ‚Äî metrics, logs, traces, and alerts are all in different places.
- Reactive, not proactive ‚Äî issues are detected after damage is done.
- Manually tuned ‚Äî autoscaling, configuration changes, rollbacks, etc. require human judgment.

**Cortex solves all three:**

| Challenge                | Traditional Approach                              | Cortex Approach                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Fragmented observability | You switch between Grafana, ELK, Prometheus, etc. | Unified event pipeline with correlated views    |
| Manual scaling decisions | Static CPU/memory thresholds                      | Predictive scaling based on ML models           |
| Post-incident response   | On-call engineer reacts                           | Cortex detects anomaly ‚Üí rolls back ‚Üí notifies  |
| Data silos               | Each service has isolated metrics/logs            | Central event stream with rich service metadata |
